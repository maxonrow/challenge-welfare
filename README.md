# Welfare

## Problem Statement

- How do we improve the process flow between businesses and the government during a pandemic? Financial operations, especially during difficult times, are prone to having low transparency, limited traceability,  delays, required intermediaries, and extra costs. While leveraging blockchain Maxonrow FT/NFT, how can we eliminate intermediaries to lower transaction costs, take back control from financial intermediaries while providing transparency to beneficiaries of welfare programs?

## Example Solution

- A secured & transparent platform for the government to provide subsidy/relief to business
- A platform for government that automate data verification and reporting, facilitate regulatory oversight, reduce operational friction, and eliminate errors associated with manual auditing.
